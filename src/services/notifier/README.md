# Notifier Service with Vertical Slice Architecture and Decorator Pattern

Notifier is a comprehensive service designed to replicate Twitter's notification functionality, delivering notifications to users through SMS, email, and web push. Leveraging the power of Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA) and the flexibility of the Decorator Pattern, Notifier provides a modular and extensible solution for multi-channel notifications.


## Features

- Multi-Channel Notifications: Send notifications simultaneously via SMS, email, and web push, ensuring a personalized and engaging user experience.
- Customizable Templates: Tailor notification content for each channel using decorators, allowing for easy customization and maintenance.
- Scheduled Notifications: Schedule notifications for a specific date and time using decorators for delayed delivery.
- User Preferences: Respect user preferences with the ability to choose notification channels and frequency through decorators.
- Vertical Slice Architecture: Organizes the application into slices, making it easy to manage and extend different notification channels.
- Decorator Pattern: Dynamically attaches behavior (notification channels) to the notification object, promoting flexibility and easy integration of new features.

## Vertical Slice Architecture
The Vertical Slice Architecture in Notifier divides the application into slices, each dedicated to a specific notification channel. This modular approach simplifies management and allows for easy extension.
## Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern in Notifier facilitates extensibility by dynamically attaching behavior to notifications. This enables the seamless integration of new channels and features without disrupting existing functionality.
