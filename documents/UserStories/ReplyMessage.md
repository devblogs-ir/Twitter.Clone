## **User Story**

As a **registered user**, I want to **reply a message** to another user.


## **Persona**



* **Registered User**: A user who has created an account on User service.


## **Need**



* **Reply to a Message**: The need to reply a private message to another user.


## **Purpose**



* **Communicate Privately**: The purpose of replying a message is to specifically respond to a message.


## **Analysis**



1. **User Flow**:
    * User selects a message from its message thread with another user.
    * User composes the reply message and sends it.
    * The system validates the user ID and allows the user to compose the message.
    * The system delivers the message to the recipient.
2. **Validation and Error Handling**:
    * Handle scenarios where the receiver has blocked sender user before reply.
    * Provide clear error messages for any validation failures.
3. **Security and Privacy**:
    * Ensure that direct messages are encrypted during transmission.
    * Protect user privacy by preventing unauthorized access to messages.
4. **Database Design**:
    * Define the schema to include fields for IsReply and ReplyMessageId(message id for the initial message which this message is a reply to it).
6. **Notifications**:
    * Implement notifications for replied messages.
    


## **Conclusion**

The “Reply Message” feature is an enhancement to message service which is important too. It helps users to chat more effectively and respond to eachother more precisely and avoid misunderstading.
